# Vqmodel

A vietnamese aircraft models factory called VQModel asked me to build a new brochure website for them, and this is the client-side for that web application.
This project is fully dedicated to a special person: Thanh Guong.

## Prerequisites

These versions are the ones used when the software was developed

If you want to check if you have all prerequisites correctly installed, run these lines in your terminal.

If all is ok, you should see the version of each software.
