# Vqmodel

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.6.

A vietnamese aircraft models factory called VQModel asked me to build a new brochure website for them, and this is the client-side for that web application.
This project is fully dedicated to a special person: Thanh Guong.
